● Difference between a Library and Framework?
Library is A collection of pre-written code you can call when you want to help with specific tasks.
Framework → A larger structure that calls your code and decides when and how parts run.

The main difference of library and framework is inverison of control.
In library the control remains with the developer, where developer will decide when to call the library function.
In framework the control gets reversed, here developer need to plug the code into the structure and framwork will call it as required.

● What is CDN? Why do we use it?
CDN is content delivery network
A CDN is a network of servers distributed across different geographic locations that store and deliver content (like images, videos, CSS, JavaScript) to users from the nearest server.

A CDN is like having multiple copies of your content in different cities, so people get the closest one quickly instead of waiting for it to travel halfway across the world.

● What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
react.development.js → Bigger, readable, shows warnings & extra checks, slower. ✅ Use in development.

react.production.js → Minified, no warnings, faster. ✅ Use in production.

Basically: Dev file = debug-friendly, Prod file = performance-friendly.
